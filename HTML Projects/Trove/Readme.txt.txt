Trove is a "Book Recommendation" Website that uses Google Book API To "Recommend" Books Based on User Input.

After a few Day , I will be removing my API KEY,So you'll have to create you own Key by using google Keys if you want to push the project.

Please Also note that Trove is a work in progress that it will be continously worked and improved on.


Things that i will add and wish to fix in the future
		-Google Tends to recommend the same Books when search the same keyword.
		-An Information Box that informs user about the issue
		-The entire about us page
		-Some animation and others bits.
